         <p> In a system that is an n-by-n grid of sites, each site is either blocked or open. Initially, all sites are blocked. A system is said to have percolated if there is an open site in the top row that can be connected to an open site in the bottom row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites.‚Äù </p>
